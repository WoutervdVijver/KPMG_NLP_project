IThe text of Article 26 of the Agreement is deleted and replaced by the following:1. 
The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably 
relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of 
the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed by or on behalf of the Contracting 
States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information 
is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting 
State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of 
that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative 
bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, 
the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of 
the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose 
the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may 
be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying 
State authorises such use.3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed 
so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:(a) to carry out administrative measures 
at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;(b) 
to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration 
of that or of the other Contracting State;(c) to supply information which would disclose any 
trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the 
disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).4. If information is 
requested by a Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of this Article, the other Contracting 
State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that 
other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding 
sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 of this Article but in no case shall such limitations 
be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no 
domestic interest in such information.5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 of 
this Article be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because 
the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, trust, foundation, nominee or person 
acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. 
In order to obtain such information the tax administration of the requested Contracting State shall have 
the power to ask for the disclosure of information and to conduct investigations and hearings notwithstanding 
any contrary provisions in its domestic tax laws.ARTICLE IIEach of the Contracting 
States shall notify the other Contracting State, through diplomatic channels, of the completion of the 
procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Protocol. The Protocol shall enter 
into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect:a) 
with respect to taxes due at source on income credited or payable on or after January 1 of the year next 
following the year in which the Protocol entered into force;b) with respect to other taxes 
charged on income of taxable periods beginning on or after January 1 of the year next following the year 
in which the Protocol entered into force;c) with respect to any other taxes imposed by or on 
behalf of the Contracting States, on any other tax due in respect of taxable events taking place on or 
after January 1 of the year next following the year in which the Protocol entered into force.ARTICLE 
IIIThis Protocol, which shall form an integral part of the Agreement, shall remain in force 
as long as the Agreement remains in force and shall apply as long as the Agreement itself is applicable.IN 
WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned duly authorised thereto by their respective governments, have signed 
this Protocol.DONE in duplicate at Brussels, on this 19th day of January 2010, in the English
